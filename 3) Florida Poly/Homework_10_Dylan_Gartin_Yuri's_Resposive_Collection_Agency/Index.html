<!-- Font's Used - Times New Roman for most text and century gothic for headings-->

<!--Design Idea - an updated Yuri's Collection Agency, Based on a phrase floating Disk in the Game says, make an entire advert for Yuri's team, Based on this phrase. this one is updated with the new knowledge we obtained this lecture to apply responsive design.
Meant to be styled to look a bit older but still easy to read. and also look like it was some sort of promotional hub for the game to show off units and get a feel for the groups used in the game-->

<!-- Resposive Design elements -  entire webpage responds well to scaleing due to a column and card based structure, using 1 and 2 columns for most of the design as well even 4 column at the end of the page to produce an interesting effect. also updated pallet and addtional design elemtns made as well to enhance User expirence-->
